                    <p>
                        A multiplayer VR game about cooking muffins and throwing them at your friends.
                        It features a large social space to organize matches and various game modes.
                        My role on the project changed over time. For the initial development,
                        I acted as a mentor for the developers working on it.
                        For a later update, I worked on the networking.

                        a public mode for free gameplay and a presentation mode where users engage 
                        with content controlled by the presenter.

                    <p>
                        Social VR is a multiplayer VR social space.
                        It was never released and was an exploration project.
                        The app featured customizable avatars, a functioning whiteboard,
                        and a ping-pong table. I was the lead developer on this project
                        and worked with an artist for the environment.

                        TEAL was my first VR project. 
                        It is a large industrial training simulation with over 70 steps 
                        and realistic interactions and immersion. The goal of the project 
                        was to provide a safe environment for workers to learn a potentially 
                        explosive operation. My role on the project was developer 
                        and I worked on the step system, animations, and VR interactions.

                        Features include healing zones, a quickly shrinking sandstorm,
                        and portals for a quick escape.

                                    in only a couple of days. I also built out most of the VR interactions 
                                    and animations.
