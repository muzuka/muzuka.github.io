                                <li> Refactored the step system in a large industrial simulation. 
                                    The new design was able to build out 70 steps and 100+ substeps 
                                    in only a couple of days. I also built out most of the VR interactions 
                                    and animations.
                                </li>
                                <li> Led the design and development of a cybersecurity app helping hundreds of kids learn about cybersecurity

                                <li> Managed an AWS server that ran an FPS game backend. I set up crash detection which would save and
                                    email a crash log and then restart the server saving developer time. </li>
                                <li> Developed a new social space for a big update to the game Muffin Fight, I rebuilt the networking system to
                                    support up to 20 VR players simultaneously. </li>
                                <li> Accelerated future multiplayer VR development by 30% through the design of a VR avatar solution
                                    agnostic to framework and networking. </li>
